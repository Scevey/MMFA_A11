For this assignemnt, all 5 of us floundered around uselessly for a bit, then met in the labs and collectively smacked our heads on a keyboard until the code worked. So we all worked on everything, all at once. As a result, there's like 1 meaningful commit. Also it was a one compile wonder. So if you wanna sauce me some extra points you know I wouldn't blame you.
